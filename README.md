# myteam Website (Frontend Mentor)

This is my personal solution to the [myteam website challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/myteam-multipage-website-mxlEauvW). 

## Overview

### The challenge

The users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- See the correct content for each team member on the About page when the `+` icon is clicked
- Receive an error message when the contact form is submitted if:
  - The `Name`, `Email Address` or `Message` fields are empty should show "This field is required"
  - The `Email Address` is not formatted correctly should show "Please use a valid email address"

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)
